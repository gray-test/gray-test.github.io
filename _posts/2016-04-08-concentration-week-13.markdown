### Week 13: Fetch Walker

This week I'm going to be shooting the character Fetch Walker from the
video game inFamous. I'll be shooting hopefully either Saturday
or Sunday, but it could possibly be Monday evening. Unfortunately
shooting on Saturday is going to be a bit of a challenge because I have
the ACT most of the day & Sunday because my dad is working. So I will have 
photos by day 2 and turn in one
final photo again. I will also begin touch-ups/slight re-edits of my
"fire jump" and mountaintop pictures which I hope to have done by the
following Friday.
