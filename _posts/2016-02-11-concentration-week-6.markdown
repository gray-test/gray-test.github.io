### Week 6 : Lightning Man

This week I'm going to be attempting another one that is similar to my
week 3 portrait of myself, but with another model. I'll be shooting
with Noah Pittenger on either Sunday or Monday in the studio at channel
8. I will have photos by day one and turn in one final photo again.
