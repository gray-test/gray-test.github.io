### Repetition

This week is repetition. I almost decided to use my free choice card,
but I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do what I want for my free
choice this week so I decided to wait until next week. I had a bit of a
hard time finding inspiration for repetition, but I did eventually find
some cool examples that I want to try. I'll be attempting to take at
least two of these over the weekend so I will have some photos day one.
