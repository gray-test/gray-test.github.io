### Week 5: The Bird, Attempt 2

I've rescheduled with my model that I was supposed to be shooting with 2 weeks
ago for this week. I'm planning on shooting Sunday with a model on location and then editing in
class during the week. I have a couple of backup concepts
planned in my head as well. I will have photos by Day 1 and turn in one
final photo.
