### Dyptichs
For this week we are doing diptychs, which means combining two photos
that are different but related to create one photo with a unified theme.
I want to photograph three different people and their favorite book(s),
movie(s), music, and piece of art. I want to do three different
generations of people to compare their different interests as well as
the different ways that they store their art.
