### Typography
Our assignment this week is to mix typography and photography. We have
to take two photos and then add text in post to add to the concept of
the photo. I have a couple ideas, "BE BOLD" and "Rise Above Yourself."
Here's a few examples that incorporate different parts of the ideas I
have. I plan to have photos by Day 2 next week.

![Image 1][type1]
![Image 2][type2]
![Image 3][type3]

[type1]: {{ "/public/img/week6/type1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[type2]: {{ "/public/img/week6/type2.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[type3]: {{ "/public/img/week6/type3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
