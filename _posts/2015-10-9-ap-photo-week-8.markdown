### Street Photography

The two weeks following our midterm assignment we will be doing street
photography. I think this needs to be candid so I can't plan too much
for exactly what kind of shot I want but here are a few examples I
like.

![example 1][street1]

![example 2][street2]

![example 3][street3]

![example 4][street4]

[street1]: {{ "/public/img/week8/street1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[street2]: {{ "/public/img/week8/street2.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[street3]: {{ "/public/img/week8/street3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[street4]: {{ "/public/img/week8/street4.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
